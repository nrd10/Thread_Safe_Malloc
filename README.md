# Thread_Safe Malloc

This reposity contains two implementations of thread-safe malloc and free functions. The first version uses a lock based synchronization to prevent race conditions while the second version uses Thread-Local Storage to prevent race conditions. The repository contains a Makefile to compile the C file into a shared library. In addition a report associated with the project details the performance of both implementations.
